Function Generator Lab written for course EECS3201

Verilog Code is written to support the ZYBO (ZYnq BOard) https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/university/XUP%20Boards/XUPZYBO/documentation/ZYBO_RM_B_V6.pdf

The source is capable of generating a sine, square, triangle and saw tooth wave on a ocillioscope. The interface
between the ZYBO and the scope is a pmod DAC. http://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-da2-two-12-bit-d-a-outputs/
